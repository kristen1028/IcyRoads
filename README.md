# Objective
IceVision Intelligence is meant to promote vehicular safety, offering cutting-edge artificial intelligence solutions designed to combat one of winter's most perilous hazards: icy roads. Our mission is to enhance road safety through advanced detection systems that alert drivers to the presence of ice, reducing the risk of accidents.

# Goals
### Enhance Product Reliability: 
Ensure that the technology is robust, accurate, and reliable under various environmental conditions. 

### Build Strategic Partnerships: 
Collaborate with automotive manufacturers, road safety authorities, and navigation app developers.

### Increase Market Presence: 
Position the brand as a synonym for safety in winter driving conditions through targeted marketing campaigns.

# Impact 
### Enhanced Road Safety: 
By providing accurate real-time data on road conditions, the technology could drastically reduce the number of accidents caused by icy roads. This would not only save lives but also reduce the number of injuries and the associated healthcare costs.

### Economic Benefits: 
Fewer accidents mean less traffic disruption, which can lead to improved productivity as people and goods reach their destinations on time. Additionally, the reduction in accidents would decrease the burden on emergency services and the costs associated with road repairs and vehicle damage.

### Driver Confidence and Comfort: 
Knowing that their vehicle is equipped to alert them about icy conditions can reduce driver anxiety during winter months, potentially leading to a more pleasant and less stressful driving experience.

# What is AlexNet?
AlexNet is a pioneering deep learning architecture that significantly advanced the field of computer vision. Key aspects include:

### Five Convolutional Layers: 
These layers extract features from images, starting with a large filter in the first layer and progressively smaller ones in subsequent layers.

### ReLU Activation Function: 
AlexNet popularized the use of ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for non-linear processing, enhancing training speed and performance compared to traditional sigmoid functions.

### Max Pooling: 
Applied after certain convolutional layers to reduce dimensionality and computational load, enhancing feature detection.

### Overlapping Pooling: 
This method, introduced by AlexNet, reduces overfitting compared to non-overlapping pooling.

### Fully Connected Layers: 
Three fully connected layers follow the convolutional layers, with the last one leading to a 1000-way softmax classification output.

### Dropout:
Implemented to reduce overfitting, dropout layers are included before the first and second fully connected layers.

### Input Size:
It accepts 224x224 RGB images as input.
